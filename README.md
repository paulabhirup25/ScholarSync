# ScholarSync
ScholarSync is a frontend web application designed to simulate a notes-sharing and selling platform for students. The project emphasizes strong UI/UX principles, responsive layouts, and user-friendly workflows for browsing, uploading, and purchasing academic notes.

Built to demonstrate frontend engineering skills, design thinking, and real-world product flow rather than backend complexity.
